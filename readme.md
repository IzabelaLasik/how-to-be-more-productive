### 1.	Pillar: Food
---
#### 1.2 **Drink enough water**
**Drinking water boosts your brain's reaction time**. The recommendation of the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine is:
- **Women**: about 9,2 cups (**2,2 liters**) of fluids a day
- **Men**: about 12,4 cups (**3 liters**) of fluids a day

There are studies that strongly show the importance of drinking enough water for mental performance. Lead study author, Dr. Caroline Edmonds of the University of East London School of Psychology, told Medical News Today, “Our study found that reaction times were faster after people drank water, particularly if they were thirsty before drinking.” [[Source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27825957/)] 
#### 1.3 **Avoid table sugar**
**Sugar makes you feel tired.** Avoid sweets, sweet beverages **(even energy drinks)** and sweetened breakfast cereal.  <br>
Turns out, glucose levels have a dramatic impact on your mental sharpness and ability to stay focused. If you eat foods that contain a lot of sugar and simple carbohydrates, such as pasta made from white flour or white bread, your body releases more insulin. Insulin is a peptide hormone that rapidly lowers blood sugar levels. Eating these foods causes an initial rise in blood sugar and a rapid insulin response. So, when your body releases extra amounts of it, blood sugar levels can plummet. You're dead tired after eating, have little energy, can't concentrate.

#### 1.4 **Grab small healthy snacks**
**Having small snacks regularly in contrast to having big meals helps keep your energy levels consistent.** Always have healthy snacks like nuts, protein bar shakes and fruits on hand. <br>
Just because you're tired after a meal doesn't mean you should give it up completely. Try to eat smaller portions of balanced meals throughout the day to keep energy and glucose levels stable. Studies show a correlation between a higher glucose level in blood and impairment in episodic memory. [[Source](https://diabetesjournals.org/diabetes/article/57/2/440/13132/Increased-Glucose-Levels-Are-Associated-With)]
Nuts, protein bars or shakes and unsweetened yogurt with fruits are a good choice
#### 1.5 **Integrate more brain foods in your diet**
P**rovide your brain with nutrients it needs**. What you eat affects your well-being. Having a nutrient rich diet enables the body to work at high speed. It is scientifically proven that your brain function can be increased by brainfood. [[Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2805706/)]
- **Omega-3** (DHA & EPA) <br>
**Integrate fish or omega-3 supplementation in your diet to increase learning and memory capabilities**. <br>
You probably already know that DHA, along with EPA is one of the fatty acids that nutrition experts call essential. The human body cannot produce them itself. Brain cells are composed of 50 to 60 % fat. Of this, 10 to 15 % is made up of the fatty acid DHA alone. The omega-3 are involved in signal transmission between the brain cells. Studies show that Ingestion of omega-3 fatty acids increases learning, memory, cognitive well-being, and blood flow in the brain. [[Source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36381743/)]
You can find DHA & EPA in: fatty fish and seafood. In case you don't consume these products you may consider supplementation.
-	**Antioxidants** <br>
**Eat fruits and vegetables every day. They have antioxidants that  inhibit the death of neurons.** <br>
The role of antioxidants is among others to neutralize free radicals, unstable molecules that can damage DNA. Antioxidants can prevent oxidative stress to brain cells. Flavonoids from cocoa were found in clinical research studies to inhibit the death of neurons by interfering with free radicals in the brain. The primary flavonoid in cocoa and chocolate is called epicatechin, which was found to improve cognitive function in animals and humans. [[Source](https://www.cuimc.columbia.edu/news/dietary-flavanols-reverse-age-related-memory-decline)]
Other good sources of antioxidants linked with brain health are berries or green tea.
-	**B-Vitamins** <br> 
**Consume B-rich foods like eggs, yogurt, legumes, sunflower seeds and leafy greens. For energy-yielding processes.** <br>
Vitamins B1, B2, B6, B12 and biotin are responsible for metabolism of nutrients for energy and the production of messenger substances for nerve impulse transmission. [[Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4772032/)] <br>
There are some substances or plant extracts that can have a positive impact on mental performance but they will be discussed at another point.
### 2.	Pillar: work planning and during work

#### 2.1 Set daily goals
**Make a daily To-do List with task you want to accomplish to keep the dopamine pumping**. <br>
Setting goals and effectively achieving the goals results in a hormonal reward in our brain. Released dopamine is a chemical messenger, communicating messages between nerve cells in your brain and your brain and the rest of your body. When dopamine flows into the brain's reward pathway (the part responsible for pleasure, learning and motivation), we feel more motivated and grab the next task in order to feel this rewarding feeling again. In this way you stay in this productivity circle. [[Source](http://blog.idonethis.com/the-science-of-motivation-your-brain-on-dopamine/)]
#### 2.2 Long-term planning
**Make a list with steps (milestones) incl. deadlines that are needed to achieve a bigger goal or finish.** <br>
Long-term planning makes it possible to prioritize effectively and improve the time management. The “big picture” ensures motivation because it reflects our dreams and aspirations. By planning tasks ahead, you already imagine yourself accomplishing your goal. This is called future retrospection and could be proved in studies as beneficial for completing. It has been shown that planning reduces anxiety, increases confidence, and leads to more effortful actions. Further, goal setters feel closer to the end goal in terms of time when they envision success rather than failure. [[Source](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797617715510)]
#### 2.3 Take breaks
**Don't skip the lunch break.** <br>
At this point research is united. Taking breaks (micro-breaks, lunchtime breaks and longer breaks) has been shown to have a positive relationship with wellbeing and productivity. By taking regular breaks you can boost your performance [[Source](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858066)].
Regularly taken breaks reduce stress and this helps maintain performance throughout the day.[[Source](https://journals.humankinetics.com/view/journals/jpah/12/1/article-p109.xml)] [[Source](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-32531-008)]
There is also scientific research about what the break should be like. Baird, Smallwood, and colleagues (2012) found that “Taking a break involving an undemanding task improved performance on a classic creativity task far more than taking a break involving a demanding task, resting, or taking no break. [[Source](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797612446024)] Breaks involving social interactions are also very recommended. [[Source](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Productivity-Through-Coffee-Breaks:-Changing-Social-Waber-Olgu%25C3%25ADn/597093a720b7c70aa6b039850e62f1a43f764a7f)]

#### 2.4 Turn off the notifications and **kill distractions**
**Set up your “do not disturb modus” on your computer and inform your colleagues with a Slack / Teams status.**<br>
In a study from the University of California Irvine researchers found out it takes a full 23 minutes to recover your focus after a distraction. [[Source](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~gmark/chi08-mark.pdf)] The sum of the time lost trying to concentrate again after an interruption is hereby significant. McKinsey could find out that when workers are in flow, they are up to five times more productive.
### 3.	Pillar Take care of yourself (and your brain)

#### 3.1	Physical activity
**Go for a walk.** <br>
This point doesn´t mean that you need to run a marathon. The best way is to integrate movement into the daily routine, a walk in the morning or during the lunch break is a good start. Cardio training is a good option as well because of the increased blood flow the nutrients and oxygen can reach the brain. Physical activity has a positive effect on neurogenesis, the process of production of new brain cells. Furthermore, movement enhances mood and wellbeing. These factors are connected with high performance as well. [[Source](https://www.fastcompany.com/3056872/exercise-makes-you-grow-new-brain-cells-but-only-the-right-kind-of-exercise)]
#### 3.2	Social connection
**Make some plans for the weekend.** <br>
The newest study shows the connection between social relationships and a protein Interleukin-6, which is produced by different cells of the body. Not enough social relationships and consequently low level of IL-6 is associated with inflammation and weak immune system. In one study participants with evidence of inflammation had worse scores for processing speed and reaction time [[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S266635462100212X)]. Correspondingly, a walk with a friend during the lunch break is a perfect brain boost activity. 
#### 3.3	Avoid brain killers
There are some substances and activities that can stop neurogenesis or even kill the brain cells. 
- **Chronic stress** <br>
Meditate to lower your stress level and sleep enough.
Stress can increase productivity (stress-productivity phenomena). The problem occurs when there is a chronic stress situation. More precisely it is the hormone cortisol, which is released during a stressful situation and attacks our hippocampus, which is involved in memory and learning (it is the reason for blackouts during a stressful situation like an exam). There are studies that show that during chronic stress the hippocampus starts to shrink. [[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1074742711000517)]
-	**Junk food and alcohol** <br>
Avoid high processed food and alcohol.
Bad diet can influence brain performance in two ways. First, a bad diet doesn’t deliver the needed nutrients that the brain needs to work properly. Secondly there are substances that are responsible for reducing the number of brain cells like alcohol. [[Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5683005/)]
